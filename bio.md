I, Matthew Ellis, am passionate about making the World a Better Place, One Good Idea at a time! 

Ideas that I am currently developing span an array of disciplines including: Neuroscience, Ophthalmology, 
Neurology, Virtual Reality, Social Networking, Education, and the Arts.

For example, can an neuroscience and virtual reality be combined to produce unprecedented advances 
in learning? 

Additionally, can social networking principles be adapted such that Advances in Knowledge can be 
catalogued and discussed in real-time, similarly to how News and Events currently diffuse across social networks? 

Take a look at my Current Projects see the above and more!
